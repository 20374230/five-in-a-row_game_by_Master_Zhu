# five-in-a-row_game_by_Master_Zhu
A in C++ five-in-a-row game  the author created when was a beginner
I finish this project when I first learnt C++ two years ago. I was exhausted to utilize all my C++ knowledge then. 
This project is based on easyx, because I knew nothing about Windows programing then. Easyx is convenient and simplified in calling Windows API such as mouse callbacks.
As to this five-in-a-row game, I tried my best to accomplish the function I came up to, including gamers' display , which indicates whose turn it is, restart, withdraw and exit.
This project is also the first one I upload to Github. Now maybe I enter in the coder's world.
